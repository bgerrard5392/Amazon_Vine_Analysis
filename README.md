# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview:
For my project I was tasked with analyzing Amazon Vine Member reviews program to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. Amazon Vine is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products, these reviews are helpful for marketing their products through Amazon. 

I've chosen a dataset from Amazon reviews on video games sold on Amazon. From these reviews, my goal was to determine if there was a correlation between the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program compared to reviews that were written by unpaid users (all other users). This correlation will enable me to see if there in fact is any bias toward favorable reviews from Amazon Vine members.


## Results:
